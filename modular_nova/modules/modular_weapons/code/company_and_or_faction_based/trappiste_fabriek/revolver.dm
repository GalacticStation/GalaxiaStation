		or even just stuck into your waistband, while still coming loaded with eight .35 sol rounds. \
		As they modernized, it started living a second life with executives, bodyguards, and criminals, due to it's ease of concealment. \
		If bang for your buck was the focus, you can't do much better then the bare minimum in both cost, and size. \
		There's not alot to be said about the actual function of the gun either, with a centerline barrel, and being shot from the lowest chamber relative to the sights, \
		the recoil is non-existant, just like the user's safety. The only out-of-place feature, is that the chamber is pressed forward during firing, \
		forming a seal in a manner that still allows it to be suppressed, whatever the use of that could be."
