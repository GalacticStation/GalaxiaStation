	desc = "Spoken colloquially by the Mothfolk of Va Lumla, the early iteration of Mothic emerged when Fueljacks relied on their receptors for simple, one-worded pheromones to communicate, and navigate the often fatal maintenance tunnels sprawled throughout the fleet. \
	 The moths developed gesticulation through antennas and wings to convey deeper intent, with mandibles providing emotional context through clicks and trills. \
	 Human speakers can achieve a similar effect from clicking their tongue to roof and steer the tone with the width of their mouth while using their hands in place of antennas. \
	 Itâ€™s informally spoken, deploying many slangs and shorthands from Common. Has phonetic resemblance to Italian."
