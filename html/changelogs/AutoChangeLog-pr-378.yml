changes:
  - bugfix: "Autopunctuation no longer checks for underscores at the end of messages."
  - bugfix: "Autopunctuation now correctly inserts EOL periods for any bolded/italicised/underline messages without them, if they don't already have punctuation of their own (like exclamation marks, tildes, question marks, or hyphens)."
