  - rscadd: "A new variant of the DeForest civil defense medical kit is now available: the civil defense symptom support kit. Loaded with three pens of psifinil and a bottle of alifil, this little thing'll fit in your pocket and give your characters guaranteed relief from sleepiness, stuttering and sickliness. Some side effects may occur. Consult your doctor before use. This new kit is available cheaply from cargo and from medical's departmental orders, too."
  - balance: "People with the Spacer or Narcolepsy quirks now start with a civil defense symptom support kit. Spacers no longer start with a bottle of atrociously, unbelievably useless ondansetron patches."
