changes:
  - rscadd: "Cargo, and the rapid construction fabricator, are now hosts to a new source of power. The stirling generator, operating something like the old TEG, creates power from large differences in temperature. Handy!"
  - rscadd: "A variety of special kitchen machines have been created for the rapid construction fabricator. While they might not perform *too* much different from their standard counterparts, they are easier to move around and can be printed whole."
  - rscadd: "Three new crates have been added to cargo, each one featuring a bundle of frontier equipment. In the service tab, kits for frontier kitchens and botany chemical synthesizers can be found. In the engineering tab, the colony starter kit can be found."
  - qol: "Many flatpack machines that were needlessly large have been made normal sized, meaning they fit inside of backpacks now!"
  - bugfix: "A large number of flatpack machines that were missing custom materials now have them, meaning they can now be recycled as well."
  - image: "New sprites for all the new machines and whatnot made by me"
  - spellcheck: "Every instance of Flat-packed has been changed to Flat-Packed where appropriate"
