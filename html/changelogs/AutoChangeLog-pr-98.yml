  - balance: "Kahraman Heavy Industries no longer sells base mining equipment that the station can just get. Instead their selection has been updated with a new selection of exploration and mining equipment fit for the frontier."
  - rscadd: "Step aside colony core, there's a new sheriff in town. The organic materials printer, a green machine you make from a pile of flatpack parts from cargo. With a little input of plant matter, you can print yourself some grade A frontier equipment, or some organic materials, its up to you."
  - rscadd: "There's a new piece of kit for marking your locations, the GPS beacon. Coming in a small size deployable item, it can be turned into an anchored, stationary GPS marker that you can use and rename to your liking. Don't like where it is? No worry, just pack it back up and move it elsewhere."
  - rscadd: "Bluespace miners are so last codebase. Check out the hip new mining device from Kahraman: the Ore Thumper. Set one up outdoors with some wired power, and watch it slam away at the ground. After it works for long enough, the pressure built up by all that slamming will make deeply buried ore come to the surface."
  - rscadd: "Looking for some frontier fashion? Some top notch kit? Kahraman has you covered with the new frontier clothing lineup. Now you too can buy equipment completely overrated for your cushy station adventures."
  - sound: "New sounds added for the new ore thumper, as well as a neat new radio sound effect for the new frontier headset."
  - image: "New sprites for the new machines, clothing, and whatever else in Kahraman are made by me, paxilmaniac, how dreamy."
